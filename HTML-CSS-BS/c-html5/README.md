# Using HTML 5 Tags
---
## Purpose

We designed this beginner's tutorial with the purpose of helping developers who are new to the HTML language and want to make some simple pages. The tutorial covers HTML 5 tags and how you can incorporate them into your HTML pages.


### Getting Started: Prerequisites

All you need to get started is Text Editor and Browser of choice. Additionally, basic knowledge of creating HTML pages would help. See HTML Foundations Examples for more insight.

- **Visual Studio Code**: For this tutorial, we will use Microsoft Visual Studio Code in order to edit our HTML code. You may choose to use another text editor if you feel comfortable doing so.

- **Google Chrome**: For this tutorial, we will use Google Chrome in order to view our HTML pages. You may choose another browser if you prefer.

## Step 1: Set Up an HTML file

Follow previous instruction for creating an HTML file. To do so in Visual Studio Code, click on: New -> New File. Make sure to end the file name with .html to add the html file extension. Example:

    hello.html

Once the file is created, add any basic HTML elements you wish. We will add in some HTML 5 elements in the step below.

## Step 2: Add DOCTYPE Tag to HTML File

Many tags are optional in development. Your browser is fault tolerant and will attempt to add any missing HTML tags that you didn't provide. However, to ensure that your HTML page is using HTML 5 you will want to explicitly add in the following tag before all code.

    <!DOCTYPE html>

Most developers will add this code into the file by default to ensure that the browser knows that it could be receiving HTML5 code.

## Step 3: Add HTML 5 Tags

HTML 5 tags work the same way as the rest of HTML tags do. They are just new tags added in HTML5. They provide additional use cases for developers to have at their disposal. Below are some examples of using HTML5 tags. See HTML-Demo for a fully prepared HTML file.

```
<header>
    <h1>Header of my Page</h1>
</header>

<footer>
    <h4>Footer of my Page</h4>
</footer>
```

## Step 4: Test HTML in a Browser

Follow the steps outlined in the HTML Fundamentals Example for opening your HTML within a browser. You will need to copy the File Path of the HTML page you wish to open and paste that into your browser of choice.
